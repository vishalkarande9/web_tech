Hi this Vishal Karande . I have created a mcq questionare app like quizup using Angularjs  , Bootstrap, Expreesjs, Mongodb .
While creating this website following are the challenges that I faced:
1) Db Connection to backend using express.js.

Number of hours logged on this project is approximately 15-20 hours.

I learned how to make websites using Js framework ,bootstrap and how to connect to db .
